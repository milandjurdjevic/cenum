## Object oriented alternative to C# enum [![latest version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/cenum)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/cenum)

objects. They could have fields, properties and methods - just as other types do.
The only difference would be that there would only ever be one instance for each value.
